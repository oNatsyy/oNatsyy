## 📊 About Me

Hi! I’m Natiq, a Data Analyst driven by curiosity and a passion for uncovering meaningful insights from data.

I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science, specializing in Mathematical Applications in Probability and Statistics and minoring in Computer Science.

Currently, I’m working at RBC Investor Services as a Corporate Actions Analyst, where I focus on data validation, reconciliation, and management. My interests lie at the intersection of data analytics, machine learning, and finance, where I enjoy uncovering patterns that drive real business value.

I’m also working toward the Analytics: Essential Tools and Methods MicroMasters® certification, having completed ISYE6501: Introduction to Analytics Modeling and currently enrolled in MGT6203: Data Analytics for Business.
